# Image Classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

This repository contains MATLAB code for image classification using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based on moments and entropy features. The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Teddy vs. Not Teddy Classification**: The first part of the code classifies images as "Teddy" or "Not Teddy" based on calculated moments and entropy. It operates on a dataset of images containing teddy bears and other objects.

2. **Car vs. Not Car Classification**: The second part of the code classifies images as "Car" or "Not Car" using similar techniques as the first part. It operates on a separate dataset containing images of cars and other objects.

## Features
- Utilizes MATLAB for numerical computing and image processing tasks.
- Extracts moments and entropy features from grayscale images.
- Trains Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification.
- Demonstrates how to load image datasets, preprocess images, and perform classification tasks.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/love-0710/image-svm-classification.git


## Navigate to the repository directory:
  cd image-svm-classification

    Run the MATLAB scripts for each classification task:
       * Run teddy_classification.m for the Teddy vs. Not Teddy classification.
       * Run car_classification.m for the Car vs. Not Car classification.

    Follow the instructions in the scripts to load datasets, preprocess images, train SVMs, and evaluate classification performance.

## Requirements

    MATLAB environment with Image Processing Toolbox installed.
